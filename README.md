### PS - It may sent this to your parents :shhh:



Browsing is not just a task! its a adventure!!! and that adventure desevers a whole book to itself!!
use this extension to create that book!! you can make new chapters, add new cards and enjoy the journey!!!!

## Why Chrome Story??
I was really bored of the normal history mode in chrome which just shows me a bunch of links and titles leaving me clueless of what actuall it was! (IYKYK)
So I decided to make this super cool chrome extension that does that for me! now I can save my browsing history in a very cool way! and whats even cooler is that you can use it as a book mark manager too! save the book marks in a very cool way!!

## What does this even do???
It has 2 modes - 
1. Auto mode - just click the button and select the chapter you want to save it in and let the magic happen!! It takes a screenshot of the current page whenever either open a new tab or if you navigate to a new page in the same tab and then saves that screenshot along with the details like Title, url, time etc in that selected chapter
2. Manual/Bookmark mode - you can always see a capture button in the popup! just press that btn and boom your page is captured!! it will be saved in the chapter you selected!!

### Want to edit some details??
DW I got you bro! just click on the manage button to open the channel list and then you can set new titles! delete some chapters ( you can't keep some stuff you know :P, hahahaha)
want to edit a card?? you can just delete a card!! but why? cause why the hell do you want to edit a card?? are you trying to hide something.....Shhshhshshsh just delete it :D

### It even has toasts
yeah you can dip this in tea :D 
but the messages you will get is the coolest part!! HAHAHAHAH

## Export button???????
YES you can also export your chapters! 
There are two possible ways you can do that -
1. JSON -  just for the nerdy people who want to access the raw data :D or even scrap the whole book through a APi or what lol :P ( note: The images will be in base64 format, imagine the length of that string :D )

2. PDF - this is for the weaks!! just get a ready made pdf file with all the images ( the actual images not just a unreadable base64 string :D ) and it also contains all the necessary details! and the links are even clickable!!!!
